# Ubuntu Image Fetcher 🖼️

A Python script that mindfully fetches images from the web and saves them locally — inspired by the Ubuntu principles of **community, respect, sharing, and practicality**.  

This tool helps you download one or multiple images by simply pasting their URLs. It organizes all fetched images inside a folder called `Fetched_Images`.

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Fetch one or multiple images at once (comma-separated URLs)  
- ✅ Creates a `Fetched_Images` directory automatically  
- ✅ Skips non-image links (checks HTTP headers)  
- ✅ Avoids duplicates by hashing files  
- ✅ Gracefully handles connection errors  
- ✅ Adds `.jpg` extension if missing  
- ✅ Saves images in binary mode so they open correctly in Windows

# 🌍 Ubuntu Principles in Action

**Respect:** Handles errors gracefully without crashing.  

**Sharing:** Stores all images neatly in one folder for reuse.
